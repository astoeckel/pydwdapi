PyDWDApi
========

![Temperature map example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astoeckel/pydwdapi/master/docs/example_temperature.png)

*PyDWDApi* is a simple HTTP REST server which allows interpolated access to
weather data made available by the German Weather Service (Deutscher
Wetterdienst, DWD). Only yields sane results for locations within Germany.

Usage
-----

This program requires Python 3, including the Python packages `numpy`, `scipy`
and optionally `matplotlib`. You will also need a free GDS-FTP account which you
can request [here](http://www.dwd.de/DE/fachnutzer/dienstleister/grundversorgung/grundversorgung_node.html) (note that account activation may take up to an hour).

### Running the Webserver

The HTTP server can be started using the following command line:
```bash
./serve.py <DWD FTP USER> <DWD FTP PASSWORD> <HTTP PORT>
```
Where the `<DWD FTP USER>` and `<DWD FTP PASSWORD>` are your GDS-FTP account
data. Note that the HTTP server will only listen on localhost. If you intend to
publish the service on the internet, you should consider using a reverse proxy
such as *nginx*.

### Using the REST API

You can now query the weather data from HTTP using the following URL:
```
http://localhost:<PORT>/api/1.0/weather?lat=<LATITUDE>&lon=<LONGITUDE>&alt=<ALTITUDE>
```
The parameters have the following meaning:

* `lat`: Latitude in degrees
* `lon`: Longitude in degrees
* `alt`: Altitude in meters above sea level -- if not given, the altitude will
be read from the local altitude map.

An example result might be the following (some keys may not be available at all
times):
```javascript
{
  "coord": {
    "alt": 89.0, // Altitude in meters above sea level
    "lat": 50.0, // Latitude
    "lon": 8.27 // Longitude
  },
  "dt": 1469663046.0, // Timestamp of the latest data incorporated in the result
  "main": {
    "humidity": 80.14, // Humidity in percent
    "precipitation": 0.0, // Precipitation in mm/m^2 in one hour
    "pressure": 1017.67, // Pressure in hPa
    "temp": 18.05 // Current temperature in degrees Celsius
  },
  "wind": {
    "deg": 63.23, // Wind direction
    "max": 2.0, // Maximum wind speed in m/s (in 10 min)
    "speed": 1.51 // Speed in m/s (avg. over 10 min)
  }
}
```

### Test Server

An instance of the server is publicly available at
```
https://somweyr.de/pydwdapi/api/1.0/weather?lat=<LATITUDE>&lon=<LONGITUDE>&alt=<ALTITUDE>
```
Please use this URL for testing purposes only.

### Plotting Maps

Plotting maps requires an installation of `matplotlib` for Python 3. You can
invoke the map plotter with the following command:

```bash
./render.py <DWD FTP USER> <DWD FTP PASSWORD> <MODALITY>
```
As above, `<DWD FTP USER>` and `<DWD FTP PASSWORD>` are your GDS-FTP account
data. The `<MODALITY>` argument can be one of the following:

* `temperature`
* `precipitation`
* `pressure`
* `humidity`
* `wind_speed`
* `wind_direction`

The rendered map will be stored as `<MODALITY>.pdf` in the current working
directory. The necessary computations will take some time -- if you're in
a hurry, you can reduce the map resolution by passing a smaller value for
the `resolution` parameter to the `api.render_map` call (try 128 or 64 instead
of the default of `256`.


How it works
------------

### Step 1: Querying
The program is extremely simple. When a request is received, it downloads the
newest station data for Germany and Europe from the DWD GDS FTP server. The
individual observations are stored in a local database. The accumulated, most
recent data for each station is used. New data is only queried from the server
after some time has passed (30 minutes for the German dataset, 3 hours for the
European dataset, see `data/sources.xml`).

### Step 2: Coordinate Association
The stations are then associated with their coordinates using a hand-crafted
table (see `data/stations.xml`). The resulting compound data is stored in a
NumPy structured array.

### Step 3: Interpolation
The individual modalities are interpolated for the given coordinate triple using
the SciPy radial basis function interpolator. A non-euclidean norm is used to
make sure that a geodesic distance is used for the station-to-station distance.

Furthermore a higher weight is used for altitudinal differences, as these have a
potentially higher impact on weather data. E.g. temperature data from the
Zugspitze from 2900 meter above sealevel (where it is quite cold most of the
time) would influence the data in the entirety of south Germany if the altitude
dimension would not be scaled correctly in the underlying metric.

ToDo
----

This project is not yet fully finished. The following features are planned:

* Interpolation of the general weather status code (clear, cloudy, rain, ...)
* Prettier map generation
* Make sure response JSON is compatible with `openweathermap`
* Perform some cross-validation experiments


Disclaimer
----------

This project was a little Sunday afternoon fun project. **Do not** use the
resulting data for any serious application. Interpolation between sparse weather
station data **may go terribly wrong**. This program is in no way affiliated
with or endorsed by the DWD.

Altitude data
-------------

The included altitude data for Germany was downloaded from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the National Centers for Environmental
Information. You can download your own data from
[here](http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/wcs-client/). Make sure to select the
`ETIOI1 (ice)` layer and `ArcGIS ASCII Grid` as output format.
