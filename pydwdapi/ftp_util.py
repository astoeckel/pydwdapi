    Downloads either the newest files from a directory on an FTP server or the
    newest files since the given Unix timestamp. Returns an array of triples,
    with each triple containing the file modification date as UNIX timestamp,
    the file name and the binary content of the file. Oldest files are returned
    first, newest last.

    session: ftplib.FTP
        Instance of ftplib.FTP which is already loggeded into an FTP server.
    path: array
        Path from which the data should be downloaded.
    matcher: function
        Function which will be called with a filename. Should return True if the
        file is consistent with some naming scheme and considered for being
        downloaded, False otherwise.
    since: None or number
        If none, only the newest file from the directory which matches will be
        downloaded. Otherwise all files which are newer than the given Unix
        timestamp will be downloaded.
